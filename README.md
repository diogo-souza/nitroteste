# Branch Develop
### Branch develop was created to improve some resources of the main code, but the Develop Code IS NOT MERGED at the MAIN OR CORES, it's just a suggestion

## Screen Web and Mobile Develop
It's the same of the basics screen
![Tela Develop](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/1c53cf74-c6ca-4dfe-bdea-edbac3d3842d)

But when the order number is searched at the search-Bar, a loading Screen appears to suggest "working progress" to the user
![Telas de loading](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/92254764-23ec-4a78-91b5-8763fc50d04f)

And then, if the search results on a valid order number. A button appears at the bottom page. THIS BUTTON OPENS A MODAL TO SEND THE ORDER STATUS TO A EMAIL
![Button develop](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/de5735b5-3875-4a83-b9f0-dd825892f12f)

And While the email is being typed, the onChange will verify if it's valid or not with a Regular Expression. If all works fine, the email is sended and a sucess message appears before the modal closes

Then, now. Verifying the email was sended just right!!

![grunt](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/c3b1cc40-5650-4bed-8fd6-a7a27a320621)

## After Running with Grunt, the Terminal Message and the Folders Generated:
