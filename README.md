# Branch Develop
### Branch develop was created to improve some resources of the main code, but the Develop Code IS NOT MERGED at the MAIN OR CORES, it's just a suggestion

## Screen Web and Mobile Develop
It's the same of the basics screen
![Tela Develop](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/229a5ffb-03b6-479a-8ed8-3fdd48dea96f)

But when the order number is searched at the search-Bar, a loading Screen appears to suggest "working progress" to the user
![Telas de loading](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/d75603cc-fe5f-4c52-877e-664f28d526ab)

And then, if the search results on a valid order number. A button appears at the bottom page. THIS BUTTON OPENS A MODAL TO SEND THE ORDER STATUS TO A EMAIL
![Button develop](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/97ac7212-bb16-47be-a50c-629e3ec472d9)

And While the email is being typed, the onChange will verify if it's valid or not with a Regular Expression. If all works fine, the email is sended and a sucess message appears before the modal closes

Then, now. Verifying the email was sended just right!!

# Simple Backend
## To send the emails was used a simple backend with Node/Express using SENDGRID. The code:

# Automatization with Grunt
## For automatizate and minify some codes was used Grunt, follows a part of the code:
![grunt](https://github.com/diogo-souza/nitroteste/assets/38789584/d6d26ef2-7951-4882-aeeb-f7e694931ce0)

## After Running with Grunt, the Terminal Message and the Folders Generated:
